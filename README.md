# ToDo -
# Project Overview
The Dark Mode To-Do List is a simple yet efficient web-based task management application. 

This project enables users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks in a clean and visually appealing dark-themed interface. 

The tasks persist using localStorage, ensuring users don't lose their data even after refreshing the page.

# Features
✅ Add Tasks – Users can input a task and add it to the to-do list.

✅ Mark Tasks as Completed – Clicking on a task toggles its completion status.

✅ Delete Tasks – Users can remove tasks from the list.

✅ Persistent Storage – The app saves tasks in the browser’s localStorage, so they remain available even after a page reload.

✅ Responsive Design – The interface is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Technology Stack

HTML – Provides the structure of the webpage.
CSS – Defines the styling, including the dark mode theme.
JavaScript – Handles user interactions, task management, and local storage.

# How It Works
Users enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.

The task appears in the list below, and each task has a Delete button.

Clicking on a task toggles its completion status (indicated by a style change).

Clicking the Delete button removes the task from both the UI and local storage.

Tasks are stored in localStorage, so they persist even after a page refresh.
