# ToDo -
Project Overview
The Dark Mode To-Do List is a simple yet efficient web-based task management application. This project enables users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks in a clean and visually appealing dark-themed interface. The tasks persist using localStorage, ensuring users don't lose their data even after refreshing the page.

Features
âœ… Add Tasks â€“ Users can input a task and add it to the to-do list.
âœ… Mark Tasks as Completed â€“ Clicking on a task toggles its completion status.
âœ… Delete Tasks â€“ Users can remove tasks from the list.
âœ… Persistent Storage â€“ The app saves tasks in the browserâ€™s localStorage, so they remain available even after a page reload.
âœ… Responsive Design â€“ The interface is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technology Stack
HTML â€“ Provides the structure of the webpage.
CSS â€“ Defines the styling, including the dark mode theme.
JavaScript â€“ Handles user interactions, task management, and local storage.
How It Works
Users enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
The task appears in the list below, and each task has a Delete button.
Clicking on a task toggles its completion status (indicated by a style change).
Clicking the Delete button removes the task from both the UI and local storage.
Tasks are stored in localStorage, so they persist even after a page refresh.
Future Enhancements

ðŸš€ Drag & Drop â€“ Enable reordering of tasks.
ðŸš€ Due Dates & Notifications â€“ Add reminders for tasks.
ðŸš€ Categories/Labels â€“ Organize tasks into different categories.
